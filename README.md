## Description

The 'Eses Composition Guides' is a ComfyUI custom node designed as a comprehensive, non-destructive visualization tool. It overlays a wide array of customizable compositional guides onto a live preview of your image, allowing for precise analysis and planning without altering the image that is passed through the workflow.

üí°All settings are controlled via simple widgets with instant feedback, and the node is optimized to handle large images without slowing down the UI.

üí°If you have ComfyUI installed, you don't need any extra dependencies!


## Features

* **Live Preview**:
    * The node displays a preview of the connected image with the selected guides overlaid.
    * All guides update in real-time as you adjust their settings, providing instant visual feedback.

* **Comprehensive Guide Library**:
    * **Grid**: A standard grid with customizable row and column counts.
    * **Diagonals**: A simple X-cross to find the center and main diagonal lines.
    * **Phi Grid**: A grid based on the Golden Ratio (1.618) for classic compositional balance.
    * **Pyramid**: Draws triangular guides with options for "Up / Down", "Left / Right", or "Both" orientations.
    * **Golden Triangles**: Overlays triangles based on the Golden Ratio, with options for different diagonal sets.
    * **Perspective Lines**: A powerful single-point perspective guide with a movable vanishing point (X and Y) and an adjustable number of lines.

* **Customizable Appearance**:
    * Full control over the color (RGB or RGBA) and blend mode of the guide lines to ensure visibility against any image.

* **Performance & Quality of Life**:
    * **Non-Destructive**: The node is a pass-through tool, meaning it never modifies the original image or mask.
    * **Resolution Limiter**: A `preview_resolution_limit` setting, a smoother UI experience by downscaling large images for the preview.
    * **Automatic Resizing**: The node's preview area automatically adjusts to match the aspect ratio of the input image.
    * **Clean UI**: Controls are consolidated into logical groups and dropdowns to save screen space.


## Requirements

* PyTorch (you should have this if you have ComfyUI installed.)

## Usage

* Connect an `image` to the input. 
* ‚ùóYou'll have to press 'Run' once and then the node will display a preview of the image. 
* Use the widgets on the node to toggle and configure the various compositional guides. 
* All changes will be reflected instantly in the preview area. 
* The original image is passed unmodified through the `image` output for use in the rest of your workflow.


## Inputs

* **image** (`IMAGE`): The input image to display in the preview.
* **mask** (`MASK`, *optional*): An optional mask input, which is passed through.


## Outputs

* **image** (`IMAGE`): A passthrough of the original, unmodified input image.
* **mask** (`MASK`): A passthrough of the original, unmodified input mask.
